# VirtualScreening

Title: Enrichment assessment of virtual screening approaches

(Inspiration: This is Java code for 'enrichvs' package in R)

Performs:

a) Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC)

b) Area Under the Accumulation Curve (AUAC)

c) Robust Initial Enhancement (RIE)

d) Boltzmann-Enhanced Discrimination of ROC (BEDROC)

e) Enrichment Factor (EF)

The test dataset is taken from http://dud.docking.org/r2/

A list with 88888 observations on the following 2 variables.

energy (scores)
-99.7 -98.3 -97.4 ...

label (0,1)
0 0 0 ...
